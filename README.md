# hello-world

This is my first repo on github. 
I will share here some academic materials concerning the following topics: Multivariate Statistics, Data Mining, Statistical Learning, Advanced Statistical Models (Bayesians and Spatials), Applied Economics and Stochastic Processes.

I'm strongly passionate about Microeconomics, Probability and Data Science; in particular during my studies I have found very fascinating the Decision Theory Under Uncertainty, which shows in a clear way how these subjects are interdependent. 

I want to thank you all the inspiring professors that I've met during my studies and who teach me in class or through their materials what I master now. 

Most of the pages that I will publish in this section are my personal notes based on professors' materials / lessons. All credits goes to them, namely: \
Riccardo Borgoni for Spatial Statistics (Point Poisson Processes and Spatial Stochastic Processes)\
Nicola Lunardon for Multivariate Statistics (Dimensionality-reduction, Discriminant Analysis, Trees, Neural Networks)\
Matteo Manera for Applied Economics & Econometrics (applications on STATA of economic models, micro-foundations)\
Sonia Migliorati for Bayesian Statistics (inference and MCMC algorithms)\
Gianna Monti for Computational Statistics \
Andrea Ongaro for Stochastic Processes \
Matteo Pelagatti for Economic Statistics (UCM, Kalman Filtering, Time Series)\
Aldo Solari for Statistical Learning & Data Mining
