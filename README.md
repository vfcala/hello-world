# hello-world

This is my first repo on github. 
I will share here some academic materials concerning the following topics: Multivariate Statistics, Data Mining, Statistical Learning, Advanced Statistical Models (Bayesians and Spatials), Applied Economics and Stochastic Processes.

I'm strongly passionate about Microeconomics, Probability and Data Science; in particular during my studies I have found very fascinating the Decision Theory Under Uncertainty, which shows in a clear way how these subjects are interdependent. 

I want to thank you all the inspiring professors that I've met during my studies and who teach me in class or through their materials what I master now. 

Most of the pages that I will publish in this section are my personal notes based on professors' materials / lessons. All credits goes to them, namely: 
- Borgoni Riccardo for Spatial Statistics (Point Poisson Processes and Spatial Stochastic Processes, ...)
- Lunardon Nicola for Multivariate Statistics (Dimensionality-reduction, Discriminant Analysis, Trees, Neural Networks, ...)
- Manera Matteo for Applied Economics & Econometrics (applications on STATA of economic models, microeconomic modelling, ...)
- Migliorati Sonia for Bayesian Statistics (Inference, Decision Theory and MCMC algorithms, ...)
- Monti Gianna for Computational Statistics (Algorithms to sample from probability distributions, Bootstrap, ML estimations, ...)
- Ongaro Andrea for Stochastic Processes (Markov Chains, Gaussian Processes, Brownian Motion, Poisson Processes, ...) 
- Pelegatti Matteo for Economic Statistics (Unobserved Components Model, Kalman Filtering, Time Series, ...)
- Solari Aldo for Statistical Learning & Data Mining (Splines, GAM, High-Dimensioanl Inference, False Discoveries, Knockoffs, Boosting...)
