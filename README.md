# hello-world

This is my first repo on github. 
I will share here some academic materials concerning the following topics: Multivariate Statistics, Data Mining, Statistical Learning, Applied Economics and Stochastic Processes.

I'm strongly passionate about Microeconomics, Probability and Data Science; in particular during my studies I have found very fascinating the Decision Theory Under Uncertainty, which shows in a clear way how these subjects are interdependent.
